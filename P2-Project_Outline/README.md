For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

See attached PDF.

Pipe Dream is a restroom locator and reviewer similar to Yelp.  It will allow users to search for nearby restrooms and access information about those restrooms (including the type of business, its address and hours, and the features available at that location, such as wheelchair accessibility, changing tables, gender neutral options, etc.).  Users will also be able to create an account in order to add new restroom locations or rate and review an existing location.  In creating this application, we hope to provide a useful tool for people needing ADA-compliant or gender-neutral facilities, parents or caregivers of young children, and people who are travelling in an unfamiliar area.

### Features

Search: By location, features, and/or business.
Create post: Users can submit a new restroom location or post a review of an existing restroom.
User login (With authentication): Users will be able to log in to create posts, see previous posts, and add new restrooms.

### Technologies

App Functionality: A REST API with Java and JavaScript (React) 
Appearance: BootStrap
Map: Google API for the locations of restrooms
Database: MySQL
Data: Yelpâ€™s Open Source Data Set (JSON files)

### What I'll Have to Learn

React
How to build a REST API.
How to use data from a public API.
How to write client-side and server-side code separately and combine them into one application.
